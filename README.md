# Handprint JOSS paper

Update 2022-03-30: This repository is no longer relevant. The paper files have been incorporated into the main [handprint](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/handprint) repository in the branch `joss-paper`, to match the requirements for JOSS submission (which apparently require the paper to be in the same repo as the software).
